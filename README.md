# EPITECH Pool challenge

## Introduction

This is a challenge based on the EPITECH Pool, inspired by its 2018 C version.

All the exercises are verified through Makefile compilation (`make`).  
Pass all the Criterion tests to succeed on each exercise.  
You may **open an issue** if a Criterion script doesn't seem to be working properly.  
The final Makefile, located in `/`, executes (and if they all pass, verifies) all the exercises at once.

## Requirements

- A gcc(>= 4.9+) compiler
- make
- [Criterion](https://criterion.readthedocs.io/en/master/setup.html) (optional, for faster testing)
- [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/downloads/?src=www.discoversdk.com) (optional, for memory checks)
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation) (optional, for norm checks)
- [gcovr](https://gcovr.com/en/stable/installation.html) (optional, for coverage checks)
- A text editor (Vim, Emacs, VSCode, etc.)
- A terminal (Bash, Zsh, etc.)
- A brain (optional)

A [static Criterion install](https://github.com/Snaipe/Criterion) is located in `/criterion/`.  
**Please open an issue if it results in the impossibility to compile/run the tests.**  
Criterion tests for each exercise are run with the command `make run`.

## Exercises

The 30 exercises are located in `/exercises/`, ready to code with (fake) headers and expectations are listed as comments.  
The exercises are to be completed with most library functions prohibited; specification are listed above each prototype. Needed includes are already in the headers.  
You may notice that the exercises are not all equal in difficulty, so you may want to practice them individually before attempting a full run.

## Tips & Speedrun

Not gonna lie, using Copilot to generate the code is cheating. It pretty much defeats the purpose of the challenge in one TAB hit.  
Feel free to turn this into a speedrun, using tools like [LiveSplit](https://github.com/LiveSplit).
