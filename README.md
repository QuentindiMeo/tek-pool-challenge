# EPITECH Pool challenge

This is a challenge of the EPITECH Pool, inspired by its 2018 C version.

All the exercises are verified through Makefile compilation (`make`).
Criterion tests for each task are run with the command `make run`. Pass them all to succeed on the exercise.
The final Makefile, located in `/run/`, executes (and if they all pass, verifies) all the exercises at once.

The 30 tasks are located in `/exercises/`, ready to code with (fake) headers and expectations are listed as comments.
