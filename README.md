# EPITECH Pool challenge

This is a challenge based on the EPITECH Pool, inspired by its 2018 C version.

All the exercises are verified through Makefile compilation (`make`).  
Criterion tests for each task are run with the command `make run`. Pass them all to succeed on the exercise.  
The final Makefile, located in `/`, executes (and if they all pass, verifies) all the exercises at once.

The 30 tasks are located in `/exercises/`, ready to code with (fake) headers and expectations are listed as comments.  
The exercises are to be completed with most library functions prohibited; specification are listed above each prototype.  
You may notice that the exercises are not all equal in difficulty, so you may want to practice them individually before attempting a full run.

Not gonna lie, using Copilot to generate the code is cheating. It pretty much defeats the purpose of the challenge in one TAB hit.  
Feel free to turn this into a speedrun, using tools like [LiveSplit](https://github.com/LiveSplit).
